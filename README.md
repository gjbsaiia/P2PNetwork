## Basic P2PNetwork
### Working on a basic peer sharing service accross unix devices, written in java
### For Networks
### For each peer using the service the p2p folder must be copied in as is, and should be placed 
### on the desktop. To be integrated into the network you need to edit the config_sharing.txt file 
### and list the IPs of how ever many peers you know. Then you need to edit the key.txt file in 
### the idKey folder, and write a key unique to you.
### This p2p network was developed for and ran on the EECS servers at CWRU.
### I've removed the IP information from this upload.
